A Simple Chip8 Emulator

Currently only supports the basic (or "legacy") CH8 mode programs.
To start, run the emulator and select the file to be loaded from the GUI.
You can stop the currently running program from the main window.

Enabling the Debug mode allows you to step through individual instructions.

You can change the clock speed using the GUI.
 
There are currently no plans to update this to also support the SCHIP mode, as I only started this project for educational purposes.
