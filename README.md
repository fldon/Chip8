A Simple Chip8 Emulator

Currently only supports the basic (or "legacy") CH8 mode programs.
To start, run the emulator and give the path to the program to be loaded on the command line when prompted.
 
 
 TODO:

-make rendering wait and timers depend on clock/execution cycles instead of time: that way, only the execution speed is relevant

-Add schip mode that can be toggled via a CLI parameter at startup

-Add GUI Frontent, where user can restart emulator with new program and switch modes, also add debug output

-Include debug mode, where one instruction is loaded with each keypress

-Make running speed configurable using the frontend

-make keybindings configurable using the frontend

(optional) Add XO-Chip mode
