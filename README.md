TODO:
-put it on github and develop there from now on

-make rendering wait and timers depend on clock/execution cycles instead of time: that way, only the execution speed is relevant

-Add schip mode that can be toggled (for now) via a CLI parameter at startup

-Add GUI Frontent, where user can restart emulator with new program and switch modes, also add debug output

-Include debug mode, where one instruction is loaded with each keypress

-Make running speed configurable using the frontend

-make keybindings configurable using the frontend

(optional) Add XO-Chip mode
